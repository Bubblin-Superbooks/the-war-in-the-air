And sometimes they was cheerful and sometimes they was 'orrible, 'orrible beyond words. And once 'e come to a place called Piccadilly, Teddy, and there was lights blazing like daylight and ladies and gentlemen in splendid clo'es crowding the pavement, and taxicabs follering along the road.

And it seemed to 'im SUDDENLY THEY SAW 'IM, and the women began to look at 'im and say things to 'im&mdash;'orrible&mdash;wicked things. One come very near 'im, Teddy, right up to 'im, and looked into 'is face&mdash;close. And she 'adn't got a face to look with, only a painted skull, and then 'e see; they was all painted skulls.</p></div> </div>
