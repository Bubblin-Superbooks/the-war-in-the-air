Great things bigger than fifty 'ouses, bigger than the Crystal Palace&mdash;bigger, bigger than anything, flying about up in the air and whacking at each other and dead men fallin' off 'em. T'riffic! But, it wasn't so much the people they killed as the business they stopped. There wasn't any business doin', Teddy, there wasn't any money about, and nothin' to buy if you 'ad it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But 'ow did the people get KILLED?&rdquo; said the little boy in the pause.</p><p>&ldquo;I'm tellin' you, Teddy,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;It was the stoppin' of business come next. Suddenly there didn't seem to be any money. There was cheques&mdash;they was a bit of paper written on, and they was jes' as good as money&mdash;jes' as good if they come from customers you knew.</p></div> </div>
