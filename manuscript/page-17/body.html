Even from the first the green-grocer's shop which he had set up in one of the smallest of the old surviving village houses in the tail of the High Street had a submerged air, an air of hiding from something that was looking for it. When they had made up the pavement of the High Street, they levelled that up so that one had to go down three steps into the shop. Tom did his best to sell only his own excellent but limited range of produce; but Progress came shoving things into his window, French artichokes and aubergines, foreign apples&mdash;apples from the State of New York, apples from California, apples from Canada, apples from New Zealand, &ldquo;pretty lookin' fruit, but not what I should call English apples,&rdquo; said Tom&mdash;bananas, unfamiliar nuts, grape fruits, mangoes.</p></div> </div>
