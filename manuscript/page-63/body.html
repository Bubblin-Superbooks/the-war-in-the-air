<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a strangely embarrassing thing for British journalism. Never was there a more obvious or uninteresting affair; never had the world heard the story of erratic affection with less appetite or sympathy. On the other hand it was extremely curious about Mr. Butteridge's invention. But when Mr. Butteridge could be deflected for a moment from the cause of the lady he championed, then he talked chiefly, and usually with tears of tenderness in his voice, about his mother and his childhood&mdash;his mother who crowned a complete encyclopedia of maternal virtue by being &ldquo;largely Scotch.&rdquo; She was not quite neat, but nearly so. &ldquo;I owe everything in me to me mother,&rdquo; he asserted&mdash;&ldquo;everything. Eh!&rdquo; and&mdash;&ldquo;ask any man who's done anything. You'll hear the same story. All we have we owe to women. They are the species, sorr. Man is but a dream. He comes and goes. The woman's soul leadeth us upward and on!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
