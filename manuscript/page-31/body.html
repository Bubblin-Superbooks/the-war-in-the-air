<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Everybody talked of flying, everybody repeated over and over again, &ldquo;Bound to come,&rdquo; and then you know it didn't come. There was a hitch. They flew&mdash;that was all right; they flew in machines heavier than air. But they smashed. Sometimes they smashed the engine, sometimes they smashed the aeronaut, usually they smashed both. Machines that made flights of three or four miles and came down safely, went up the next time to headlong disaster. There seemed no possible trusting to them. The breeze upset them, the eddies near the ground upset them, a passing thought in the mind of the aeronaut upset them. Also they upset&mdash;simply.</p><p>&ldquo;It's this 'stability' does 'em,&rdquo; said Grubb, repeating his newspaper. &ldquo;They pitch and they pitch, till they pitch themselves to pieces.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
