<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> New York&mdash;New York doesn't even strike me as horrible. New York was nothing but an ant-hill kicked to pieces by a fool!</p><p>&ldquo;Think of it, Smallways: there's war everywhere! They're smashing up their civilisation before they have made it. The sort of thing the English did at Alexandria, the Japanese at Port Arthur, the French at Casablanca, is going on everywhere. Everywhere! Down in South America even they are fighting among themselves! No place is safe&mdash;no place is at peace. There is no place where a woman and her daughter can hide and be at peace. The war comes through the air, bombs drop in the night. Quiet people go out in the morning, and see air-fleets passing overhead&mdash;dripping death&mdash;dripping death!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
