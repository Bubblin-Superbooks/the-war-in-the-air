<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh! It's all foolishness and haste and violence and cruel folly, stupidity and blundering hate and selfish ambition&mdash;all the things that men have done&mdash;all the things they will ever do. Gott! Smallways, what a muddle and confusion life has always been&mdash;the battles and massacres and disasters, the hates and harsh acts, the murders and sweatings, the lynchings and cheatings. This morning I am tired of it all, as though I'd just found it out for the first time. I HAVE found it out. When a man is tired of life, I suppose it is time for him to die. I've lost heart, and death is over me. Death is close to me, and I know I have got to end. But think of all the hopes I had only a little time ago, the sense of fine beginnings!... It was all a sham. There were no beginnings.... We're just ants in ant-hill cities, in a world that doesn't matter; that goes on and rambles into nothingness.</p></div> </div>
