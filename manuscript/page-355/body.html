They felt as secure as spectators at a bullfight; they risked their money perhaps on the result, but that was all. And such ideas of war as the common Americans possessed were derived from the limited, picturesque, adventurous war of the past.

They were inclined to regret it as something ennobling, to sigh that it could no longer come into their own private experience.</p></div> </div>
