<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The world passed at a stride from a unity and simplicity broader than that of the Roman Empire at its best, to as social fragmentation as complete as the robber-baron period of the Middle Ages. But this time, for a long descent down gradual slopes of disintegration, comes a fall like a fall over a cliff. Everywhere were men and women perceiving this and struggling desperately to keep as it were a hold upon the edge of the cliff.</p><p>A fourth phase follows. Through the struggle against Chaos, in the wake of the Famine, came now another old enemy of humanity&mdash;the Pestilence, the Purple Death. But the war does not pause. The flags still fly. Fresh air-fleets rise, new forms of airship, and beneath their swooping struggles the world darkens&mdash;scarcely heeded by history.</p></div> </div>
