We want a fresh start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Grubb, &ldquo;badly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We want to forget things&mdash;and cut all these rotten old worries. They ain't doin' us good.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, they decided to take the risk of these bicycles, and they decided their costumes should be brown stockings and sandals, and cheap unbleached sheets with a hole cut in the middle, and wigs and beards of tow.
