One carried a gun and the other a hatchet, and they scrutinised him and his cudgel scornfully. Then he struck a cross-road with a mono-rail at its side, and there was a notice board at the corner with &ldquo;Wait here for the cars.&rdquo; &ldquo;That's all right, any'ow,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;Wonder 'ow long I should 'ave to wait?&rdquo; It occurred to him that in the present disturbed state of the country the service might be interrupted, and as there seemed more houses to the right than the left he turned to the right.
