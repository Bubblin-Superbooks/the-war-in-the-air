It made him feel deep longings that he found it wisest to fight down.</p><p>For a time the old man resigned himself to the pleasures of gustatory reminiscence. His lips moved. &ldquo;Pickled Sammin!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;an' vinegar.... Dutch cheese, BEER! A pipe of terbakker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But 'OW did the people get killed?&rdquo; asked Teddy presently.</p><p>&ldquo;There was the War. The War was the beginning of it. The War banged and flummocked about, but it didn't really KILL many people. But it upset things. They came and set fire to London and burnt and sank all the ships there used to be in the Thames&mdash;we could see the smoke and steam for weeks&mdash;and they threw a bomb into the Crystal Palace and made a bust-up, and broke down the rail lines and things like that. But as for killin' people, it was just accidental if they did. They killed each other more.</p></div> </div>
