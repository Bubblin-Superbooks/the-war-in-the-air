<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All the old settled mental habits and traditions of men found themselves not simply confronted by new conditions, but by constantly renewed and changing new conditions. They had no chance of adapting themselves.

He was Kentish and English, and that meant hops, beer, dog-rose's, and the sort of sunshine that was best in the world. Newspapers and politics and visits to &ldquo;Lunnon&rdquo; weren't for the likes of him. Then came the change.</p></div> </div>
