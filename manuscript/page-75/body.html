<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The firm of Grubb & Smallways, formerly Grubb, had indeed been singularly unlucky in the last year or so. For many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small, dissolute-looking shop in the High Street, adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles, a display of bells, trouser-clips, oil-cans, pump-clips, frame-cases, wallets, and other accessories, and the announcement of &ldquo;Bicycles on Hire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Repairs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Free inflation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Petrol,&rdquo; and similar attractions. They were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle,&mdash;two samples constituted the stock,&mdash;and occasionally they effected a sale; they also repaired punctures and did their best&mdash;though luck was not always on their side&mdash;with any other repairing that was brought to them. They handled a line of cheap gramophones, and did a little with musical boxes.</p></div> </div>
