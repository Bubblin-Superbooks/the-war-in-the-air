<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No. I was thinking of MY Edna. We've all got Ednas, I suppose, for our imaginations to play about. This was a girl. But all that's past for ever. It's hard to think I can't see her just for a minute&mdash;just let her know I'm thinking of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;you'll see 'er all right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kurt with decision, &ldquo;I KNOW.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I met her,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;in a place like this&mdash;in the Alps&mdash;Engstlen Alp. There's a waterfall rather like this one&mdash;a broad waterfall down towards Innertkirchen. That's why I came here this morning. We slipped away and had half a day together beside it. And we picked flowers. Just such flowers as you picked. The same for all I know. And gentian.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
