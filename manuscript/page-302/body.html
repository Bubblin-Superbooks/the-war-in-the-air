I bet she's got a shot or two home by now if old Schneider's up to form. Just think of it! There they are whacking away at each other, great guns going, shells exploding, magazines bursting, ironwork flying about like straw in a gale, all we've been dreaming of for years! I suppose we shall fly right away to New York&mdash;just as though it wasn't anything at all. I suppose we shall reckon we aren't wanted down there. It's no more than a covering fight on our side. All those tenders and store-ships of ours are going on southwest by west to New York to make a floating depot for us. See?&rdquo; He dabbed his forefinger on the map. &ldquo;Here we are. Our train of stores goes there, our battleships elbow the Americans out of our way there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
