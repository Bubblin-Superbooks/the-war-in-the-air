Whereupon Bert and Edna also scrabbled in the road-grit. Other cyclists arrived, dismounted and stood about, and their flame-lit faces expressed satisfaction, interest, curiosity. &ldquo;Wet sand,&rdquo; said the short, fat man, scrabbling terribly&mdash;&ldquo;wet sand.&rdquo; One joined him. They threw hard-earned handfuls of road-grit upon the flames, which accepted them with enthusiasm.</p><p>Grubb arrived, riding hard. He was shouting something. He sprang off and threw his bicycle into the hedge. &ldquo;Don't throw water on it!&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;don't throw water on it!&rdquo; He displayed commanding presence of mind. He became captain of the occasion. Others were glad to repeat the things he said and imitate his actions.</p></div> </div>
