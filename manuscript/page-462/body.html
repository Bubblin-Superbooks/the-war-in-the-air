Can't do that. No! I've got to see it through. I've got to see it through. You've got to, too. Every one.... But why?... I tell you&mdash;our world's gone to pieces. There's no way out of it, no way back. Here we are! We're like mice caught in a house on fire, we're like cattle overtaken by a flood. Presently we shall be picked up, and back we shall go into the fighting. We shall kill and smash again&mdash;perhaps. It's a Chino-Japanese air-fleet this time, and the odds are against us. Our turns will come. What will happen to you I don't know, but for myself, I know quite well; I shall be killed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
