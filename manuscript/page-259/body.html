That is evident. You shtarted for an afternoon excursion&mdash;a picnic. A man of your temperament&mdash;he would take a laty. She was not wiz you in your balloon when you came down at Dornhof. No! Only her chacket! It is your affair. Still, I am curious.&rdquo;</p><p>Bert reflected. &ldquo;'Ow d'you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I chuge by ze nature of your farious provisions. I cannot account, Mr. Pooterage, for ze laty, what you haf done with her. Nor can I tell why you should wear nature-sandals, nor why you should wear such cheap plue clothes. These are outside my instructions. Trifles, perhaps. Officially they are to be ignored. Laties come and go&mdash;I am a man of ze worldt. I haf known wise men wear sandals and efen practice vegetarian habits.</p></div> </div>
