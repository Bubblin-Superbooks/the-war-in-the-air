I saw that flying-machine man hit the funnels of the big ironclad. I saw that dead chap in the passage. I seen too much smashing and killing lately. That's the matter. I don't like it. I didn't know war was this sort of thing. I'm a civilian. I don't like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't like it,&rdquo; said Kurt. &ldquo;By Jove, no!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I've read about war, and all that, but when you see it it's different. And I'm gettin' giddy. I'm gettin' giddy. I didn't mind a bit being up in that balloon at first, but all this looking down and floating over things and smashing up people, it's getting on my nerves. See?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
