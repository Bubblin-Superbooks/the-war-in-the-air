'ow you frightened me!&rdquo; said Bert, with drops of perspiration on his brow.</p><p>He sat with his back to a tree stump all that night, holding the kitten in his arms. His mind was tired, and he talked or thought coherently no longer. Towards dawn he dozed.</p><p>When he awoke, he was stiff but in better heart, and the kitten slept warmly and reassuringly inside his jacket. And fear, he found, had gone from amidst the trees.</p><p>He stroked the kitten, and the little creature woke up to excessive fondness and purring. &ldquo;You want some milk,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;That's what you want. And I could do with a bit of brekker too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
