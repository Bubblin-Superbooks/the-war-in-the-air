He found his Edna!</p><p>He got back across the Atlantic partly by means of an order from the President and partly through his own good luck. He contrived to get himself aboard a British brig in the timber trade that put out from Boston without cargo, chiefly, it would seem, because its captain had a vague idea of &ldquo;getting home&rdquo; to South Shields. Bert was able to ship himself upon her mainly because of the seamanlike appearance of his rubber boots.</p></div> </div>
